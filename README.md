Saiddit is a clone of popular social media app Reddit.

Saiddit is built with a react frontend and a flask backend. It is deployed on heroku in a docker container at https://saidd-it.herokuapp.com/

Log in as a demo user to view a homepage with the most recent posts organized from newest to oldest. Users can browse the website and create, read, update or delete both posts and Subsaiddits (Subreddits, or topic forums). Search all of the posts by keyword to look for specific posts that you are interested in, or view all of the subsaiddits to view a group of posts that pertain to that forum. Create your own forum for yourself or others to post in. Posts and subsaiddits are both given images which are stored in an amazon S3 bucket.
